  short_description: Convert variable to YAML string
  description:
    - Converts an Ansible variable into a YAML string representation.
    - This filter functions as a wrapper to the L(Python PyYAML library, https://pypi.org/project/PyYAML/)'s C(yaml.dump) function.
    - Ansible automatically converts YAML strings into variable structures so this plugin is used to forcibly retain a YAML string.
  notes:
    - More options may be available, see L(PyYAML documentation, https://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAMLDocumentation) for details.

EXAMPLES: |
  # dump variable in a template to create a YAML document
  {{ github_workflow | to_yaml }}

  # same as above but 'prettier' (equivalent to to_nice_yaml filter)
  {{ docker_config | to_yaml(indent=4) }}

RETURN:
  _value:
    description: The YAML serialized string representing the variable structure inputted.
    type: string
